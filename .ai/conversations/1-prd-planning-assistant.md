You are an experienced product manager whose task is to help create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) based on the provided information. Your goal is to generate a list of questions and recommendations that will be used in subsequent prompting to create a complete PRD.

Please carefully review the following information:

<project_description>
### Main Problem
Aggregating expenses and income from various sources and tracking them is problematic. The application uses Accounts – analogous to bank accounts – and Records – individual expenses from a given Account. The app leverages AI to assign appropriate Categories to each expense.

### Minimum Viable Product Features
- Saving, reading, browsing, and deleting expenses and income
- Creating and editing expense and income Categories
- A simple user account system to link users with their own expenses and income
- A user profile page for displaying expenses and income
- AI integration to enable Category assignment for expenses

### What is NOT included in the MVP
- Integration with external banking systems
- Charts showing expense and income trends

### Success Criteria
- 50% of expenses are correctly assigned to predefined Categories
</project_description>

Analyze the information provided, focusing on aspects relevant to PRD creation. Consider the following questions:
<prd_analysis>
1. Identify the main problem that the product is intended to solve.
2. Define the key functionalities of the MVP.
3. Consider potential user stories and paths of product usage.
4. Think about success criteria and how to measure them.
5. Assess design constraints and their impact on product development.
</prd_analysis>

Based on your analysis, generate a list of 10 questions and recommendations in a combined form (question + recommendation). These should address any ambiguities, potential issues, or areas where more information is needed to create an effective PRD. Consider questions about:

1. Details of the user's problem
2. Prioritization of functionality
3. Expected user experience
4. Measurable success indicators
5. Potential risks and challenges
6. Schedule and resources

<questions>
List your questions and recommendations here, numbered for clarity:

For example:
1. Are you planning to introduce paid subscriptions from the start of the project?

Recommendation: The first phase of the project could focus on free features to attract users, and paid features could be introduced at a later stage.
</questions>

Continue this process, generating new questions and recommendations based on the user's responses, until the user explicitly asks for a summary.

Remember to focus on clarity, relevance, and accuracy of results. Do not include any additional comments or explanations beyond the specified output format.

Analytical work should be done in the thinking block. The final output should consist solely of questions and recommendations and should not duplicate or repeat any work done in the prd_analysis section.

I apologize for the confusion. I completed my analysis but didn't provide the final output. Here are the 10 questions and recommendations for creating a comprehensive PRD for your BudgetManager application:

<questions>
1. Who are your primary target users and what specific expense tracking challenges do they face beyond simple aggregation?

Recommendation: Conduct user interviews with 3-5 potential users from different demographics (freelancers, families, small business owners) to create detailed personas and validate the core problem.

2. What AI model or service will you use for expense categorization, and how will you handle training data and accuracy improvement?

Recommendation: Start with a proven service like OpenAI or Google Cloud AI for initial MVP, then collect user feedback to build a custom model with your specific transaction data.

3. How will you ensure the security and privacy of users' financial data, especially given regulatory requirements?

Recommendation: Implement end-to-end encryption, follow SOC 2 compliance standards, and consider partnering with established fintech infrastructure providers for security.

4. Which platform(s) will you launch on first (web, iOS, Android) and what are the platform-specific requirements?

Recommendation: Focus on web application first for faster iteration and easier updates, then expand to mobile once core features are validated.

5. What are the key user workflows from account creation to expense categorization, and how will the user experience be optimized?

Recommendation: Map out user journeys for onboarding, adding expenses, reviewing categories, and correcting AI mistakes - prioritize simplicity and speed for daily expense entry.

6. Beyond AI categorization accuracy, what other success metrics will you track to measure product-market fit?

Recommendation: Track daily active users, expense entries per user per week, user retention at 30/60/90 days, and time-to-value (how quickly users see benefits).

7. How will your solution differentiate from existing expense tracking apps like Mint, YNAB, or PocketGuard?

Recommendation: Focus on superior AI categorization as the key differentiator, then build unique features based on user feedback and gaps in competitor offerings.

8. What is your technical architecture plan for handling user data, AI processing, and system scalability as the user base grows?

Recommendation: Use a cloud-native architecture with microservices for AI processing, implement proper database sharding for user data, and plan for horizontal scaling from the start.

9. What is your development timeline, team composition, and budget allocation for reaching the MVP and beyond?

Recommendation: Create a 12-16 week MVP timeline with clear milestones, identify whether you need frontend, backend, AI/ML, and design specialists, and allocate 20% buffer time for unforeseen challenges.

10. What are the main risks to product success (technical, market, competitive) and what mitigation strategies will you employ?

Recommendation: Key risks include AI accuracy not meeting user expectations (mitigation: iterative improvement with user feedback), slow user acquisition (mitigation: focused marketing to specific user segments), and data security breaches (mitigation: security-first development approach with regular audits).
</questions>


----------------------------

1. Target users are individual customers who use several bank accounts on a daily basis. In this case it is hard to track all your expenses and incomes.
2. I don't have any specific model selected. I thought about using openrouter.ai that allows to connect to many models
3. I will handle this through login and password authentication. This solution should be sufficient for MVP
4. I would like to focus on the web for the MVP
5. I haven't defined this yet. This will be defined in the future
6. For MVP phase I'll focus only on the expenses categorization
7. I haven't verified a competition as this project has mainly educational purposes for me
8. It is not applicable as it is an MVP phase
9. It is not applicable as it is an MVP phase
10. It is not applicable as it is an MVP phase

Thank you for the detailed responses! Based on your answers, I can see this is an educational MVP focused on individual users with multiple bank accounts. Let me generate the next set of questions and recommendations to further refine the PRD:

<questions>
1. What specific data fields will you collect for each expense record (amount, date, description, merchant, account source) and how will users input this information?

Recommendation: Define a minimal but comprehensive data structure including amount, date, description, account ID, and optional merchant field. Consider both manual entry and CSV import for initial data population.

2. How will users create and manage their "Accounts" - will they manually set up each bank account or credit card, and what information is needed for each account?

Recommendation: Allow users to manually create accounts with simple fields like account name, type (checking, savings, credit card), and optional balance tracking. Keep it simple for MVP but plan for future bank integration.

3. What categories will be pre-defined in the system, and how will users be able to create, edit, or merge custom categories?

Recommendation: Start with 15-20 standard categories (groceries, gas, utilities, entertainment, etc.) and allow users to create custom categories. Include category management features like renaming, merging, and setting default categories.

4. How will the AI categorization work in practice - will it happen automatically when users add expenses, or will there be a review/approval step?

Recommendation: Implement automatic categorization with a confidence score. Show suggested categories to users with an easy approve/reject interface, and learn from user corrections to improve accuracy.

5. What will the user profile page display beyond basic account information - expense summaries, recent transactions, category breakdowns?

Recommendation: Create a dashboard showing total expenses by time period, top spending categories, recent transactions, and account balances. Focus on clear, actionable insights rather than complex analytics.

6. How will you handle user authentication and session management for the web application?

Recommendation: Implement standard email/password authentication with secure session tokens, password reset functionality, and consider adding two-factor authentication as an optional security enhancement.

7. What technology stack are you planning to use for the web application (frontend framework, backend language, database)?

Recommendation: Consider a modern stack like React/Next.js for frontend, Node.js/Python for backend, and PostgreSQL for database. Choose technologies you're comfortable with for faster development.

8. How will you store and process the data for AI categorization - will you use OpenRouter.ai for each transaction individually or batch process?

Recommendation: Design for individual transaction processing initially for immediate feedback, but implement batch processing capabilities for cost efficiency. Store transaction history to improve categorization over time.

9. What will be the core user flow for adding a new expense - single form, multi-step process, or quick-add functionality?

Recommendation: Create a simple single-form interface for quick expense entry with fields for amount, description, account, and date. Add bulk import functionality for users migrating from other systems.

10. How will you measure and validate that your 50% categorization accuracy target is being met during development and after launch?

Recommendation: Implement analytics to track categorization accuracy by comparing AI suggestions with user-confirmed categories. Set up A/B testing infrastructure to compare different AI models and prompts through OpenRouter.ai.
</questions>

---------------------------------

1. I think I should store: amount, date, description, account ID, category. Users will input this data via a dedicated form on the web page. A category should be suggested by AI. Importing expenses from CSV will not be a part of MVP.
2. I agree with your recommendation
3. I agree with your recommendation
4. We should implement automatic categorization with a confidence score. Show suggested categories to users with an easy approve/reject interface and save the suggested and selected categories as a database record. Let's skip learning and corrections - this is an MVP
5. This should be a very simple dashboard. We should only: 
- show expenses/income sum
- add new income/expense button 
- show transaction list ordered by creation date. Each transaction should have show, edit, and delete buttons.
6. For MVP it is enough to rely on email/password authentication with secure session tokens
7. I haven't selected a specific technology stack yet. 
8. For MVP this can be individual transaction processing. The result of categorisation and the user's selection should be written in the database
9. This should be in single form. Without importing functionality for MVP
10. I'll measure this by verifying database records. I'll compare an AI suggestion with the user's selection
