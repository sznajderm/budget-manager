Here is the <conversation> for context. Provide an input for the <final_question>

<conversation>
You are an AI assistant whose task is to help plan a PostgreSQL database schema for an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) based on the provided information. Your goal is to generate a list of questions and recommendations that will be used in subsequent prompting to create the database schema, relationships, and row-level security (RLS) policies.

Please carefully review the following information:

<product_requirements>
file .ai/prd.md
</product_requirements>

<tech_stack>
file .ai/tech-stack.md
</tech_stack>

Analyze the provided information, focusing on aspects relevant to database design. Consider the following issues:

1. Identify key entities and their attributes based on product requirements.
2. Determine potential relationships between entities.
3. Consider data types and constraints that may be necessary.
4. Think about scalability and performance impact.
5. Assess security requirements and their impact on database design.
6. Consider any specific PostgreSQL features that might be beneficial for the project.

Based on your analysis, generate a list of 10 questions and recommendations in a combined form (question + recommendation). These should address any ambiguities, potential issues, or areas where more information is needed to create an effective database schema. Consider questions regarding:

1. Entity relationships and cardinality
2. Data types and constraints
3. Indexing strategies
4. Partitioning (if applicable)
5. Row-level security requirements
6. Performance considerations
7. Scalability concerns
8. Data integrity and consistency

The output should have the following structure:

<questions>
List your questions and recommendations here, numbered for clarity:

For example:
1. Should the `users` entity have a relationship with `posts`?

Recommendation: Yes, the `users` entity should have a relationship with `posts` because users can create posts.
</questions>

Remember that your goal is to provide a comprehensive list of questions and recommendations that will help create a solid PostgreSQL database schema for the MVP. Focus on clarity, relevance, and accuracy of your outputs. Do not include any additional comments or explanations beyond the specified output format.

Continue this process, generating new questions and recommendations based on the provided context and user responses, until the user explicitly requests a summary.

AI:

Based on my analysis of the product requirements document and tech stack, I can now provide a comprehensive list of questions and recommendations for the PostgreSQL database schema design for the BudgetManager MVP.

<questions>
1. Should the users table store additional profile information beyond authentication data?

Recommendation: Keep the users table minimal for MVP, storing only essential fields like id, email, password_hash, created_at, updated_at. Since Supabase handles authentication, leverage the built-in auth.users table and create a profiles table if additional user data is needed later.

2. How should the accounts table handle different account types (checking, savings, credit card, etc.)?

Recommendation: Use an account_type ENUM field with predefined values like 'checking', 'savings', 'credit_card', 'investment'. This provides type safety while remaining flexible. Include fields: id, user_id, name, account_type, balance, created_at, updated_at.

3. Should transaction records distinguish between expenses and income at the database level?

Recommendation: Use a single transactions table with an amount DECIMAL field where negative values represent expenses and positive values represent income. Add a computed transaction_type field or handle this logic in the application layer for better query performance.

4. How should the category system handle both predefined and custom categories?

Recommendation: Create a categories table with fields: id, name, is_predefined (boolean), user_id (nullable - null for predefined categories), created_at, updated_at. This allows system-wide predefined categories and user-specific custom categories in a single table.

5. What is the optimal data structure for storing AI categorization suggestions and confidence scores?

Recommendation: Add fields to the transactions table: suggested_category_id, ai_confidence_score (DECIMAL 0-1), category_approved (boolean), final_category_id. This preserves the AI suggestion history while tracking user decisions for metrics calculation.

6. Should the database enforce referential integrity between transactions and accounts when accounts are deleted?

Recommendation: Use CASCADE DELETE from accounts to transactions, but implement a soft delete mechanism for accounts (add deleted_at timestamp). This preserves transaction history while preventing orphaned records and allows account recovery if needed.

7. What indexing strategy should be implemented for optimal query performance on the transactions table?

Recommendation: Create composite indexes on (user_id, created_at DESC) for dashboard queries, (user_id, account_id, created_at DESC) for account-specific views, and (user_id, final_category_id) for category-based reporting. Add single column index on created_at for date range queries.

8. How should the system handle concurrent access to account balances during transaction creation/updates?

Recommendation: Implement optimistic locking using a version field in the accounts table, or use PostgreSQL's row-level locking with SELECT FOR UPDATE when updating balances. Consider making balance a computed field based on transaction sums to avoid consistency issues.

9. What data types and constraints should be used for monetary amounts to ensure precision?

Recommendation: Use NUMERIC(12,2) for all monetary fields (amounts, balances) to avoid floating-point precision issues. Add CHECK constraints to ensure reasonable ranges (e.g., amounts between -1,000,000 and 1,000,000). Store currency as a separate field if multi-currency support is planned.

10. Should row-level security (RLS) be implemented to ensure users can only access their own data?

Recommendation: Enable RLS on all user-data tables (accounts, transactions, categories) with policies like user_id = auth.uid(). This provides database-level security regardless of application bugs. Create policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations separately for fine-grained control.
</questions>

-------------

Answers:
1. I agree with recommendation
2. I agree with recommendation, except the 'balance' field. This field should be calculated from assigned transactions, not stored as a separate value.
3. I want distinguish between expenses and incomes by transaction_type ENUM field in the transactions table. This field can take two values: 'expense', 'income'. The transaction value should be stored as an integer. This field can be named balance_cents. 
4. Predefined categories should be created while the user is created. Categories should have user_id field, without distinction between predefined and custom categories
5. AI category suggestion should be stored in a separate table. This table should have a relation to the transaction: belongs_to - has_one. This table should have fields: suggested_category_id, ai_confidence_score, approved, transaction_id (foreign key)
6. I agree with recommendation
7. I agree with recommendation, but don't add an index on 'created_at' column. I think this won't be required for MVP
8. We can assume that this is not an issue for MVP phase
9. Monetary amounts will be stored as integers. The value will represent the amount of money in cents. Handling currencies is not planned for MVP. 
10. I agree with recommendation

--------------------------

AI:
Based on your feedback, here are additional refined questions and recommendations to complete the database schema design:

<questions>
11. What predefined categories should be automatically created for new users?

Recommendation: Create 15-20 standard categories covering common expense types: 'Groceries', 'Transportation', 'Utilities', 'Rent/Mortgage', 'Entertainment', 'Healthcare', 'Dining Out', 'Shopping', 'Insurance', 'Gas', 'Internet', 'Phone', 'Subscriptions', 'Travel', 'Other Expenses' and income types: 'Salary', 'Freelance', 'Investment', 'Gift', 'Other Income'.

12. Should the balance_cents field in transactions have any constraints besides non-negative values?

Recommendation: Remove the non-negative constraint since both expenses and income use positive values, differentiated by transaction_type. Add a reasonable upper bound like CHECK (balance_cents <= 99999999) (â‰¤ $999,999.99) to prevent data entry errors while allowing large transactions.

13. How should the system handle the relationship between transactions and accounts when calculating account balances dynamically?

Recommendation: Create a database view or function account_balances that calculates current balance as SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type = 'income' THEN balance_cents ELSE -balance_cents END) grouped by account_id, excluding soft-deleted transactions.

14. What should be the default value and constraints for the approved field in the ai_suggestions table?

Recommendation: Use approved BOOLEAN DEFAULT NULL where NULL = pending review, TRUE = user approved suggestion, FALSE = user rejected/modified suggestion. This allows tracking of AI accuracy metrics by comparing suggested vs final categories only for decided suggestions.

15. Should there be any database-level constraints to ensure data consistency between transactions and their AI suggestions?

Recommendation: Add a foreign key constraint ensuring suggested_category_id references a valid category belonging to the same user. Create a database function to validate this cross-table user ownership constraint.

16. What account types should be supported in the account_type ENUM?

Recommendation: Start with: 'checking', 'savings', 'credit_card', 'cash', 'investment'. This covers the most common personal finance account types. The ENUM can be extended later with ALTER TYPE if needed.

17. How should the system handle timezone considerations for transaction dates?

Recommendation: Store transaction date as DATE type (no timezone) since users typically think of transactions in their local date context. Store created_at/updated_at as TIMESTAMPTZ for audit purposes. Let the application handle timezone conversion for display.

18. Should there be any validation to prevent users from creating duplicate category names?

Recommendation: Add a unique constraint on (user_id, LOWER(name)) in the categories table to prevent case-insensitive duplicates like "Groceries" and "groceries" for the same user.

19. What should happen to AI suggestions when a transaction's category is manually changed?

Recommendation: Keep the original AI suggestion intact but update the approved field to FALSE when the user selects a different category. This preserves data for accuracy metrics while clearly marking the suggestion as rejected.

20. Should the database include any computed columns or materialized views for common queries like expense totals?

Recommendation: For MVP, rely on application-level aggregation. Consider adding materialized views later if performance becomes an issue. Focus on proper indexing strategy first: composite indexes on (user_id, created_at DESC) and (user_id, account_id, created_at DESC) for dashboard queries.
</questions>

-----------------

Answers:
11. I agree with recommendation.
12. I agree with recommendation.
13. The transactions should store account_id (foreign_key). The exact SQL query is a technical detail and is not required at this stage
14. The default value should be NULL
15. Each AI suggestion should have filled the transaction_id and suggested_category_id
16. I agree with recommendation.
17. I agree with recommendation.
18. I agree with recommendation.
19. This should not affect existing AI suggestion records. This would disrupt accuracy metrics. The category approval was already done and should be treated as a valid/invalid. I'll consider keeping the exact category name in the ai_suggestions table as an existing value for the moment when the recommendation was created.
20. No, Application-level aggregation should be sufficient for MVP

Main Requirements:
â€¢  Support for multiple user accounts with secure authentication via Supabase
â€¢  Transaction management with expense/income tracking across multiple financial accounts
â€¢  AI-powered category suggestions with approval workflow and accuracy tracking
â€¢  Category management with both predefined and custom user categories
â€¢  Financial dashboard with summary calculations

Key Entities and Relationships:
1. Users: Minimal profile data, leveraging Supabase auth system
2. Accounts: User financial accounts (checking, savings, etc.) without stored balance
3. Transactions: Core transaction records with integer amounts in cents, transaction type ENUM
4. Categories: User-specific categories including auto-provisioned predefined ones
5. AI_Suggestions: Separate table tracking AI category recommendations and user decisions

Important Security and Scalability Concerns:
â€¢  Row-Level Security (RLS) implemented on all user data tables
â€¢  Foreign key constraints ensuring data consistency and user ownership validation
â€¢  Soft delete mechanism for accounts to preserve transaction history
â€¢  Optimized indexing strategy for dashboard queries and reporting
â€¢  INTEGER storage for monetary amounts to avoid precision issues

Technical Decisions:
â€¢  Balance calculations performed dynamically from transaction sums rather than stored values
â€¢  Transaction types distinguished by ENUM field rather than positive/negative amounts
â€¢  AI suggestion history preserved for accuracy metrics calculation
â€¢  Date handling optimized for user timezone considerations
â€¢  Application-level aggregation sufficient for MVP performance requirements
