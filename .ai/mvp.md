# Application - BudgetManager (MVP)

### Main Problem
Aggregating expenses and income from various sources and tracking them is problematic. The application uses Accounts – analogous to bank accounts – and Records – individual expenses from a given Account. The app leverages AI to assign appropriate Categories to each expense.

### Minimum Viable Product Features
- Saving, reading, browsing, and deleting expenses and income
- Creating and editing expense and income Categories
- A simple user account system to link users with their own expenses and income
- A user profile page for displaying expenses and income
- AI integration to enable Category assignment for expenses

### What is NOT included in the MVP
- Integration with external banking systems
- Expense and income imports from files or other systems
- Charts showing expense and income trends

### Success Criteria
- 50% of expenses are correctly assigned to predefined Categories
