Using .cursor/rules/supabase-auth.mdc implement the backend under the page src/pages/signup.astro and component src/components/auth/SignupForm.tsx

The logic should be consistent with @login.astro and src/components/auth/LoginForm.tsx

Take into account the behavior of supabase - after registration, a link will be sent to confirm the account by the user - inform about this.
