Your task is to implement a feature provided implementation plan. Your goal is to create a solid and well-organized implementation that includes appropriate validation, error handling, and follows all logical steps described in the plan.

First, carefully review the provided implementation plan:

<implementation_plan>
file .ai/category-suggestion-plan.md
</implementation_plan>

<types>
file src/types.ts
</types>

<implementation_rules>
files: .cursor/rules/shared.mdc, .cursor/rules/backend.mdc, .cursor/rules/astro.mdc
</implementation_rules>

<implementation_approach>
Implement a maximum of 3 steps from the implementation plan, briefly summarize what you've done, and describe the plan for the next 3 actions - stop work at this point and wait for my feedback.
</implementation_approach>

After completing the implementation, ensure it includes all necessary imports, function definitions, and any additional helper functions or classes required for the implementation.

If you need to make any assumptions or have any questions about the implementation plan, present them before writing code.

Remember to follow design best practices, adhere to programming language style guidelines, and ensure the code is clean, readable, and well-organized.
