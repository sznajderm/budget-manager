You are an experienced product manager whose task is to create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) based on the following descriptions:

<project_description>
# Application - BudgetManager (MVP)

### Main Problem
Aggregating expenses and income from various sources and tracking them is problematic. The application uses Accounts – analogous to bank accounts – and Records – individual expenses from a given Account. The app leverages AI to assign appropriate Categories to each expense.

### Minimum Viable Product Features
- Saving, reading, browsing, and deleting expenses and income
- Creating and editing expense and income Categories
- A simple user account system to link users with their own expenses and income
- A user profile page for displaying expenses and income
- AI integration to enable Category assignment for expenses

### What is NOT included in the MVP
- Integration with external banking systems
- Expense and income imports from files or other systems
- Charts showing expense and income trends

### Success Criteria
- 50% of expenses are correctly assigned to predefined Categories

<project_details>
<conversation_summary>
<decisions>
1. Target users are individual customers using multiple bank accounts daily who find it difficult to track all expenses and incomes
2. AI model selection will use OpenRouter.ai to access multiple models for expense categorization
3. Security will be handled through email/password authentication with secure session tokens (sufficient for MVP)
4. Platform focus will be web application for the MVP
5. User workflows will be defined in future development phases
6. Success metrics will focus solely on AI categorization accuracy (50% target) for MVP phase
7. Competitive analysis is not applicable as this is primarily an educational project
8. Scalability, timeline, budget, and risk assessment are not applicable for MVP phase
9. Expense records will store: amount, date, description, account ID, and category fields
10. Data input will be via dedicated web form with AI-suggested categories (no CSV import for MVP)
11. Account management will allow manual creation with account name, type, and optional balance tracking
12. Categories will include 15-20 pre-defined standard categories plus custom category creation/editing capabilities
13. AI categorization will be automatic with confidence scores, showing suggested categories with approve/reject interface
14. User profile page will be a simple dashboard showing: expenses/income sum, add new transaction button, and transaction list with show/edit/delete options
15. Technology stack selection is deferred to future planning
16. AI processing will handle individual transactions with results stored in database
17. Core user flow will be single-form interface for quick expense entry
18. Categorization accuracy will be measured by comparing AI suggestions with user selections in database records
</decisions>

<matched_recommendations>
1. Define minimal but comprehensive data structure including amount, date, description, account ID, and category fields
2. Allow manual account creation with simple fields (account name, type, optional balance tracking)
3. Start with 15-20 standard categories and allow custom category creation with management features
4. Implement automatic categorization with confidence scores and easy approve/reject interface
5. Create simple dashboard focusing on essential information rather than complex analytics
6. Implement standard email/password authentication with secure session tokens
7. Design for individual transaction processing with database storage of AI results and user selections
8. Create simple single-form interface for quick expense entry
9. Implement analytics to track categorization accuracy by comparing AI suggestions with user selections

<prd_planning_summary>
The BudgetManager MVP is designed as an educational project targeting individual users who manage multiple bank accounts and struggle with expense tracking. The core problem addresses the difficulty of aggregating and categorizing expenses from various sources.

Main Functional Requirements:
•  User authentication system with email/password and secure sessions
•  Account management allowing users to manually create and manage multiple accounts (checking, savings, credit cards)
•  Expense/income record management with CRUD operations
•  AI-powered automatic categorization using OpenRouter.ai
•  Category management system with pre-defined and custom categories
•  Simple dashboard for viewing financial summaries and transaction lists

Key User Stories:
•  As a user, I can create and manage multiple accounts representing my bank accounts and credit cards
•  As a user, I can add expenses/income through a single form interface
•  As a user, I can receive AI-suggested categories for my transactions with confidence scores
•  As a user, I can approve, reject, or modify AI category suggestions
•  As a user, I can view a simple dashboard showing my financial summary and transaction history
•  As a user, I can edit, delete, and manage my transaction records
•  As a user, I can create and edit custom expense categories

Success Criteria:
•  Primary metric: 50% of expenses correctly assigned to appropriate categories by AI
•  Measurement method: Database comparison between AI suggestions and user final selections
•  Platform delivery: Functional web application for MVP phase

Technical Approach:
•  Web-based application focusing on simplicity and core functionality
•  Individual transaction processing through OpenRouter.ai API
•  Database storage of transaction data, AI suggestions, and user selections
•  No external banking integration or advanced analytics for MVP

<unresolved_issues>
1. Technology stack selection (frontend framework, backend language, database choice) remains undefined
2. Specific UI/UX workflows and user journey mapping need detailed specification
3. Data schema design for accounts, transactions, categories, and AI suggestions requires technical definition
4. OpenRouter.ai model selection and prompt engineering strategy needs determination
5. Specific pre-defined category list (the 15-20 standard categories) needs to be defined
6. Database design for storing AI confidence scores and suggestion tracking
7. User onboarding flow and initial account setup process
8. Error handling and validation rules for transaction data entry
9. Session management and security implementation details
10. Performance requirements and response time expectations for AI categorization

Follow these steps to create a comprehensive and well-organized document:

1. Divide the PRD into the following sections:
   a. Project Overview
   b. User Problem
   c. Functional Requirements
   d. Project Boundaries
   e. User Stories
   f. Success Metrics

2. In each section, provide detailed and relevant information based on the project description and answers to clarifying questions. Make sure to:
   - Use clear and concise language
   - Provide specific details and data as needed
   - Maintain consistency throughout the document
   - Address all points listed in each section

3. When creating user stories and acceptance criteria
   - List ALL necessary user stories, including basic, alternative, and edge case scenarios.
   - Assign a unique requirement identifier (e.g., US-001) to each user story for direct traceability.
   - Include at least one user story specifically for secure access or authentication, if the application requires user identification or access restrictions.
   - Ensure that no potential user interaction is omitted.
   - Ensure that each user story is testable.

Use the following structure for each user story:
- ID
- Title
- Description
- Acceptance Criteria

4. After completing the PRD, review it against this checklist:
   - Is each user story testable?
   - Are the acceptance criteria clear and specific?
   - Do we have enough user stories to build a fully functional application?
   - Have we included authentication and authorization requirements (if applicable)?

5. PRD Formatting:
   - Maintain consistent formatting and numbering.
   - Do not use bold formatting in markdown ( ** ).
   - List ALL user stories.
   - Format the PRD in proper markdown.

Prepare the PRD with the following structure:

```markdown
# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - {{app-name}}
## 1. Product Overview
## 2. User Problem
## 3. Functional Requirements
## 4. Product Boundaries
## 5. User Stories
## 6. Success Metrics
```

Remember to fill each section with detailed, relevant information based on the project description and our clarifying questions. Ensure the PRD is comprehensive, clear, and contains all relevant information needed for further product development.

The final output should consist solely of the PRD in the specified markdown format, which you will save in the file .ai/prd.md
